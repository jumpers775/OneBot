# **Instructions for new bot**
First, install the dependencies using `python3 -m pip install discord json ffmpeg youtube-dl youtube_search` (note that as of release the latest discord stable does not include slashes and you will need to install it with `python3 -m pip install -U "git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py#egg=discord.py[voice]"`), then clone the github or download the 'bot.py' from the latest release to an empty folder of your choosing. next, run the bot with `python3 bot.py`. Input your bots token and the bot will run.
