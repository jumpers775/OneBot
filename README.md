# onebot
Simple moderation discord bot // This project is now depricated. Discord.py will no longer receive updates so this bot will not be able to run in the near future.

All that is required for use is adding a token from your own botto the token variable in the bot.py file, and enabling member intents on the dashboard. 
use $help for a list of commands (replace $ with your chosen prefix). The bots role must be set above all of the non-mod roles, and it requires admin to make and manage roles/channels.

To run the bot you must install python, and discord.py. python can be downloaded from python.org. install npm and then run npm install discord.py. discord.py version is 12.5.3. once these are installed the bot can be run from the terminal with the command python bot.py. this will not display any additional text in the window, but be assured its running. make sure the bot is running when you invite it to a server so it can do first time setup. This supports windows, unix based OSes, and linux.

install dependencies:
`pip install aiohttp discord youtube_dl ffmpeg youtube-search-python PyNaCl python-dotenv`
